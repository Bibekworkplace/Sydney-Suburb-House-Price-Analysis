This assignment aims to ensure that students understand the large variety of property data types and sources. Property data visualisations and interaction tools are frequently used for property market research and property analytics, and this assignment mimics an analystâ€™s role in real life. This assignment also ensures that students understand the different visualisation techniques when dealing with other forms of property data. The dataset you will be collecting for this assessment is from ABS Census data which contains 7 categories including property price; house finance status; ownership and household information; dwelling status; family information; population and marriage status; unemployment and employment status.
